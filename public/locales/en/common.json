Beauty does not have to be synonymous and commensurate with luxury, exclusive, and expensive materials or accessories. It can be, but it doesn't have to. At the same time, what is expensive is not always beautiful. For us, the price of beauty is the price of burying one's ego for the interested parties so that something new and fresh can grow on its ruins, which will be the result of synergy between the investor, the user, the space, and the designer."
