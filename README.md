## Project Overview

**JOFISTUDIO** is a modern frontend web application built with **Next.js**, designed as a clean and extensible foundation for building performant, SEO-friendly websites or web applications.

The project follows standard **Next.js architecture**, leveraging file-based routing, server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) where applicable. It is structured to be easily scalable and maintainable, making it suitable both as a starter template and as a base for more advanced production-ready applications.
